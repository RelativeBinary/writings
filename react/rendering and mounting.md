- we can see in this demo that passing a prop that changes to a child will change, but it will not trigger the child to rerender and reinitialise useState
- if the parent was creating children using a function like `map` and the `id`/`key` was always different then react would remove the current child and rerender a new one
	- if the `id`/`key` doesn't change then react will not trigger a redener, the will still get new props, but wont re-initialise the useState

Think of re-initialising the useState as - re-mounting the component
mounting is the first render of all the components content
rerendering is only updating what has changed in the DOM (which useState isn't in)
